Dear Rahim,

I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to take a moment to express my gratitude for your friendship and support. You have been a constant source of encouragement and positivity in my life, and I am so thankful for that.

I wanted to share with you a poem that I wrote, inspired by the beauty of the world around us and the connections we share with one another. I hope you enjoy it.

The World We Share

In the garden of existence, we dwell
Side by side, our stories to tell
Each a unique bloom, vibrant and bright
In the tapestry of life, we weave our own light

Through the seasons of change, we grow
In the sun and the rain, our spirits sow
The roots entwined, the branches embrace
A symphony of life, in this shared space

In the dance of the stars, we find our place
A cosmic ballet, in the endless expanse
A single thread, in the fabric of time
Woven together, our destinies entwine

So let us cherish this world we share
The love and the laughter, the joy and the care
For in every moment, we are connected
In the grand symphony of life, we are perfected

Thank you, Rahim, for being a part of my world. I am so grateful for you.

Sincerely,
Amanat Ali
