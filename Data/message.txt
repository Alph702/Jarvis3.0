Sure, here's another example of a WhatsApp message I can write:

Hi [Name],

I wanted to reach out and see how you're doing. I know things have been tough lately with everything going on, and I just wanted to let you know that I'm here for you if you need to talk.

We don't have to talk about anything in particular, I just want you to know that I'm thinking of you and sending positive vibes your way.

Take care of yourself and let me know if there's anything I can do to help.

Best,
[Your Name]

This message is friendly and empathetic, offering support and a listening ear to a friend or family member. It's important to show that you care and are thinking of others, especially during difficult times.

Let me know if you have any specific message you want me to write or any changes you would like me to make in this example.
