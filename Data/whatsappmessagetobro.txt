Hello Amanat Ali,

I hope this message finds you well. I am a content writer, and I can certainly help you with writing various types of content such as letters, codes, applications, essays, notes, songs, and poems.

For a WhatsApp message to your brother, here's a suggestion:

"Hey bro, I hope you're having a great day. I just wanted to check in and see how you're doing. I miss hanging out with you and talking about everything under the sun. Let's plan to catch up soon, either in person or over a video call. Take care and stay safe."

Let me know if you need any further assistance.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
