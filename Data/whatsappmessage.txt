Sure, here's another example of a WhatsApp message I can write:

Hey [Name],

Just wanted to let you know that the order you placed has been shipped and is on its way to you. You should receive it in the next 2-3 business days.

If you have any issues with the order or need to return it for any reason, please don't hesitate to contact us. We're here to make sure you have a great experience with our company.

Thanks for choosing us, and we hope you enjoy your new [product]!

Best,
[Your Name]

This message is friendly and informative, providing the customer with an update on their order and offering assistance if needed. It also includes a call-to-action to reach out if there are any issues, and it ends with a positive note.

Let me know if you have any specific message you want me to write or any changes you would like me to make in this example.
